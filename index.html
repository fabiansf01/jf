        1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding population
        1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
        1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields
        1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University
        2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
        2009 - dies at the age of 95.
